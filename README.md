This repository contains a very simple Lisp interpreter written in Scala. It's inspired by Michael Nielsen's essay ["Lisp as the Maxwell's equations of software"](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/), itself derived from [Peter Norvig's simple Lisp interpreter written in Python](http://norvig.com/lispy.html).

See the blog entry at http://www.janvsmachine.net/2013/07/writing-simple-lisp-interpreter-in-scala.html for details.
